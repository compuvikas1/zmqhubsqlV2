	we need to restore the three databases kept in the folder c:\s2trading\zmqhubresource\dbbackup
	LPINTRADAY.bak

Step 3:

FeedHandler (Server Side Code)
------------------------------

	Open the FeedHandler in  Visual Studio 2015
	Then Change the compilation option to release and cpu mode to x64.

	Rebuild the whole solution.

	For running the exe we need to do the below steps

		First we need to run the Logger with the below command
			Logger.exe logger.config

		Second we need to run the publisher which will fetch the details from the db and publish it using zmq.

Step 4:
OrderManagementV2 (Server Side Code)
------------------------------------

	This program for now we will run on the server (158.69.193.253). 
	Since we have provided this static IP for Fix Order Routing.

Step 5:

ScannerWindowApplication (Client Side Code)
-------------------------------------------

This program we can run on the client side to display the feeds on scanner.
Route the orders to OrderManagementV2.
Fetch the orders from the db and display on the OrderBlotter.
